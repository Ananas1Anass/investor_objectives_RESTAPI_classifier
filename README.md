# mdata_test

This is the core feature for a consulting firm in IT. Basically it is a data task and backend task.

What can we add? 
1. Some frontend layer.
2. Adding more features
3. User Authentication and Authorization
4. Rate Limiting
5. CORS Configuration
6. Asynchronous Processing
7. Webhooks for External Notification.

   This goes without saying about the level of difficulty of each one. Neverthless it is a good exercice to test your skills about turning a ML project into a product.
