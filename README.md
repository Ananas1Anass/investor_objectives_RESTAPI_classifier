The exercise requires creating and validating a classifier for investor objectives and then integrating it into a REST API web service for single-player queries.

What can we add? 
1. Some frontend layer. :heavy_check_mark:
2. Adding more features. Brainstorming in progess..
3. User Authentication and Authorization. Under construction
4. Rate Limiting
5. CORS Configuration
6. Asynchronous Processing
7. Webhooks for External Notification.

   This goes without saying about the level of difficulty of each one. Neverthless it is a good exercice to test your skills about turning a ML project into a product.
